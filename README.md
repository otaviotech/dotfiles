# Dotfiles

These are my workspace day to day preferences.

Dotfiles are managed using [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

# Install

Run the automated installation. This will setup **almost** everything.

```shell
cd ~
wget https://github.com/otaviotech/dotfiles/blob/main/install-macos.sh
chmod +x install-macos.sh
./install-macos.sh
cd -
```
